		article: "the top ten strategic technology trends are all about building the intelligent digital mesh how artificial intelligence is driving everything that we do across many systems going into the future it's about the digital world bringing the virtual world in the real world together into a new digital reality and it's about connections that's the mesh connecting people connecting processes connecting things together in new and interesting ways it's the convergence of all of this and using it to support a continuous innovation process autonomous things is the first trend on our strategic technology trend list autonomous things is about using AI technology to drive new capabilities in hardware and software systems on the land with autonomous vehicles in the air with drones and even on the sea with autonomous shipping when we look at this world of autonomous things it's not just those Hardware systems it's software as well so we're gonna see autonomous things in the digital world with intelligent agents working on our behalf our second trend is augmented analytics augmented analytics is about not replacing people with AI systems but augmenting people specifically with augmented analytics it's around the world of analytics and business intelligence so we're creating citizen data scientists imagine a world using natural language interfaces where a sales manager can say what are the biggest issues that are going to impact my sales and whether I'm going to hit quota next month the system then can automatically bring together the right data sets look at lots of different hypotheses around that and come up with insights that you otherwise would not have had AI driven development is the third trend on our strategic technology trend list ai driven development is about using AI in the context of the development process it's about making it easier to create AI enabled systems will eventually see AI driven automated code generation we're starting to see automated testing tool and seeing automated model generation as well the fourth trend is digital twin a digital twin is a digital representation of a real-world thing that are connected together we can have digital twins of people processes and things have the equipment manufacturers Airlines and others are using this concept of the digital twin to monitor real-world assets and drive significant savings in maintenance and repair and operations areas and over time we're going to link the digital twins of various processes of people in things together to support smart cities and similar initiatives empowered edge is the fifth trend on the strategic technology trend list the Empowered edge is all about how we're driving greater capabilities into those edge devices there's three key things that we're looking at here number one is cloud to the edge looking at how cloud computing is not competing with the edge but we're using cloud architectures to deliver capabilities and manage capabilities out to the edge it's also about actually empowering those edge devices with AI chips greater compute capabilities more storage and finally it's about communicating to the edge so things like 5g that are going to start ramping up next year and growing over the next five years are going to really drive edge computing our sixth trend on the list is immersive experience immersive experience is all about how humans interact with the digital world how we perceive the digital world is changing and this is the world of augmented and virtual and mixed reality something like remote assistance we see companies using this to say have an expert engineer work with somebody in a remote factory to get a piece of equipment back online saving millions of dollars of the production line is not down but it's also about how we interact with the digital world and this is where we see various conversational platforms through smart speakers and chat BOTS and things like that creating customer service agents etc blockchain is a seventh trend on our strategic technology trend list blockchain is a ledger but it's a shared ledger a distributed ledger an immutable ledger with an algorithmic based trust model to validate the transactions that are going in the ledger the key value proposition around blockchain is reducing business friction and technology friction as this ledger is independent of individual applications and potentially operating across companies smart spaces is the eighth trend on our strategic technology trend list smart spaces is about creating environments and bring a number of technologies and trends together in an integrated fashion to support targeted persona or user category or a specific industry scenario examples of smart spaces include advanced digital work places connected factories are smart cities as we go forward it's not about looking at a smart city with a bunch of individual applications or components but it's integrating it together to create a digital twin of that city the ninth trend is privacy and ethics just because we can do something with artificial intelligence should we and we've seen major privacy challenges one example is a fitness tracking company that had a cool idea to track where their users were unfortunately some of those fitness trackers were used by military people in Iraq and so suddenly information about the location of these soldiers was published on the Internet just because we can gather all this information about people should we our tenth trend is quantum computing let me tell you how to think about quantum computing imagine you had a giant library with millions and millions of books a classic computer would read all those books in a linear fashion but really really fast with quantum computing it's like reading all the books at the same time quantum computing has a potential to solve problems in chemistry material science and other areas that are impossible to solve today these are the trends that you can't afford to ignore these are the trends that are going to power your continuous next process these are the trends that are going to underlay your creation of the intelligent digital mesh these are the trends that are going to create business value and your differentiation of the future you"

Shows Promise Assisting Physicians - The New York Times</a></blockquote> <p>Each year, millions of Americans walk out of a doctor’s office with a misdiagnosis. Physicians try to be systematic when identifying illness and disease, but bias creeps in. Alternatives are overlooked. Now a group of researchers in the United States and China has tested a potential remedy for all-too-human frailties: artificial intelligence. In a paper published on Monday in Nature Medicine, the scientists reported that they had built a system that automatically diagnoses common childhood conditions — from influenza to meningitis — after processing the patient’s symptoms, history, lab results and other clinical data. The system was highly accurate, the researchers said, and one day may assist doctors in diagnosing complex or rare conditions. Drawing on the records of nearly 600,000 Chinese patients who had visited a pediatric hospital over an 18-month period, the vast collection of data used to train this new system highlights an advantage for China in the worldwide race toward artificial intelligence. Because its population is so large — and because its privacy norms put fewer restrictions on the sharing of digital data — it may be easier for Chinese companies and researchers to build and train the “deep learning” systems that are rapidly changing the trajectory of health care. On Monday, President Trump signed an executive order m</p>'
